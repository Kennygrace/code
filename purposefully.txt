 	PURPOSEFULLY BY PASTOR EMMANUEL IREN

  What Purpose Is Not:
*Purpose is not Happiness
*Purpose is not Unique
*Purpose is not Career
*Purpose is not determined by the Purposed
*Purpose is not Assignment

When it really comes to understanding purpose, these questions must be asked:
* What is God's chief aim for all mankind?
* What is that one thing for which I was created and at which I must succeed,n otherwise nothing else will count?

The chief aim and purpose of every man is simply this:
* To know Christ
* To make him known
